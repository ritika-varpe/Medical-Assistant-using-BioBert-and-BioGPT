Multimodal Generative AI for Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Insights

An AI-powered medical assistant that leverages state-of-the-art biomedical language modelsâ€”BioBERT and BioGPTâ€”to assist healthcare professionals and patients in understanding and generating biomedical information.

Project Goals
Enhance Clinical Decision Support: Provide healthcare professionals with accurate, real-time information extracted from vast biomedical literature to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.
Automate Biomedical Text Analysis: Streamline the extraction of relevant data from medical texts, research papers, and clinical notes to reduce manual workload.
Improve Patient Interaction: Develop a system capable of understanding and generating human-like responses to patient queries, thereby improving patient engagement and education.

Implementation Process
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather large-scale biomedical corpora, including PubMed abstracts and clinical notes.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality inputs for model training.

Model Selection and Training:

BioBERT: Utilized for tasks requiring understanding of biomedical terminology, such as named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction. BioBERT is pre-trained on large biomedical corpora, enhancing its ability to understand complex medical texts.

BioGPT: Employed for generative tasks like answering patient queries or summarizing medical documents. BioGPT is a domain-specific generative Transformer model pre-trained on extensive biomedical literature.

System Integration:
Develop an interface that allows seamless interaction between the user and the backend models.
Implement APIs to facilitate communication between different system components.

Evaluation and Optimization:
Test the system using benchmark datasets to evaluate performance in tasks like NER, question answering, and text generation.
Optimize based on feedback and performance metrics to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Key Features
Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Identify and classify terms such as diseases, drugs, and genes within medical texts using BioBERT.
Enhances information retrieval and data organization.

Relation Extraction:
Determine relationships between biomedical entities, such as drug-disease interactions, leveraging BioBERT's capabilities.
Facilitates the construction of knowledge graphs for better data visualization.

Question Answering:
Respond to user queries by extracting relevant information from biomedical literature using BioGPT.
Supports clinicians and patients in obtaining quick answers to medical questions.

Text Summarization:
Generate concise summaries of lengthy medical documents, aiding in faster comprehension and decision-making.
Interactive Chat Interface:
Provide a user-friendly platform for users to interact with the system, ask questions, and receive information in real-time.
